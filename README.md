# My NeoVim configuration
Configuring NeoVim can be a time-consuming process, but this time around, 
I decided not to use LSP-Zero and opted for a custom configuration from scratch. \
Additionally, I have incorporated several interesting plugins to enhance my editing experience, 
such as GitSigns, Vim-Fugitive, and UndoTree.

Here are some preview screenshots of my configuration in action:
