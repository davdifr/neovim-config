# NeoVim Configuration (No Longer Maintained) üöß

Configuring NeoVim can be a time-consuming process, but this time around, I decided not to use LSP-Zero and opted for a custom configuration from scratch. Additionally, I have incorporated several interesting plugins to enhance my editing experience, such as GitSigns, Vim-Fugitive, and UndoTree.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that as of October 7, 2023, this NeoVim configuration is no longer actively maintained.

Here are some preview screenshots of my configuration in action:

Feel free to explore and adapt this configuration to your needs, but keep in mind that it may not be up-to-date with the latest plugins or NeoVim versions.
